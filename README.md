## 🚀 Live Project Overview

This project develops a time series forecasting model using SARIMA to predict Apple (AAPL) stock prices and deploys the trained model through an interactive Streamlit web application.

It demonstrates:

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🔬 Stationarity Testing & Differencing
- 📈 ACF/PACF-based Parameter Selection
- 🤖 SARIMA Model Training
- 💾 Model Serialization with Pickle
- 🌐 Web App Deployment using Streamlit
- 📅 Dynamic Future Forecast Generation

# 📌 Business Problem

Financial markets are dynamic and volatile. Investors require reliable forecasting methods to:

- Understand historical trends
- Predict short-term price movement
- Support investment decision-making

This project answers:

> Can historical Apple stock data be used to statistically forecast future prices using classical time series modeling?

---

# 🧠 Why SARIMA?

Stock prices often show:

- Long-term trends
- Autocorrelation patterns
- Seasonal fluctuations
- Non-stationary behavior

A simple linear model cannot capture these patterns effectively.

SARIMA was selected because it:

✔ Handles non-stationary time series  
✔ Models autocorrelation  
✔ Captures seasonality  
✔ Works well for short-term financial forecasting

# 📊 Dataset Description

**Source:** Historical Apple stock price dataset  
**Time Period:** 2012 – 2019  
**Frequency:** Daily  

### Features:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Date | Trading date |
| Open | Opening price |
| High | Highest price |
| Low | Lowest price |
| Close | Closing price (Target Variable) |
| Volume | Trading volume |

### Target Variable:
📌 `Close` Price

---

# 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1️⃣ Data Cleaning

- Converted Date to datetime format
- Set Date as index
- Checked missing values
- Sorted chronologically

## 2️⃣ Trend Analysis

- Observed upward long-term trend
- Identified volatility clusters
- Detected cyclical movement

## 3️⃣ Stationarity Testing

Time series models require stationary data.

### Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test

Hypothesis:

- H₀ → Time series is non-stationary
- H₁ → Time series is stationary

After differencing:
- Achieved stationarity
- Removed trend component

# 📐 Model Architecture

## 🔹 ARIMA Model

ARIMA(p, d, q)

Where:

- **p** → Autoregressive terms
- **d** → Differencing order
- **q** → Moving average terms

---

## 🔹 SARIMA Model

SARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q, s)

Where:

- (p, d, q) → Non-seasonal parameters
- (P, D, Q) → Seasonal parameters
- s → Seasonal cycle length

---

# 🧮 Mathematical Representation

The SARIMA model can be expressed as:

Φₚ(B) Φₚₛ(Bˢ) (1 − B)ᵈ (1 − Bˢ)ᴰ Yₜ = Θ_q(B) Θ_Q(Bˢ) εₜ

Where:

- B → Backshift operator
- Φ → AR parameters
- Θ → MA parameters
- εₜ → White noise

This allows the model to:

- Learn past dependencies
- Remove trends
- Capture repeating seasonal patterns

---

# ⚙️ Model Training Process

### Step 1: Stationarity Check  
### Step 2: Differencing  
### Step 3: ACF & PACF Analysis  
### Step 4: Parameter Selection  
### Step 5: Model Fitting (statsmodels)  
### Step 6: Residual Diagnostics  
### Step 7: Model Serialization  

```python
pickle.dump(model, open("sarima_model.pkl", "wb"))
```

---

# 📉 Model Evaluation

Evaluated using:

- AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
- Residual white noise check
- Forecast consistency with historical trends

### Why AIC?

Lower AIC = Better model balance between:
- Complexity
- Goodness of fit

---

# 🔮 Forecasting Strategy

The deployed model:

- Accepts user-defined future date range
- Generates up to 30-day forecast
- Uses business-day frequency
- Displays:
  - Forecast table
  - Historical vs predicted graph

Core Forecast Code:

```python
forecast = model.forecast(steps=forecast_days)
```

---

# 🌐 Streamlit Deployment

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit to provide:

✔ Interactive UI  
✔ Date selection  
✔ Real-time predictions  
✔ Visual comparison plots  
✔ No retraining required  

Run locally:

```bash
streamlit run AppleStockModelDeployment.py
```
